To-Do List Application 📝
A simple and user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing daily tasks. This Python-based project allows users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with persistent storage to save tasks between sessions.

Features 🚀
View Tasks: See a list of all tasks with their statuses (completed or pending).
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
Update Tasks: Modify the title of an existing task.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Keep track of tasks you have finished.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in a tasks.json file, so they are saved even after exiting the program.
